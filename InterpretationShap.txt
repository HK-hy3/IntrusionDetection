Here is a summary of the **SHAP GRAPHS** for each kernel:

**1. Linear Kernel:**
*Top Influential Features:*

dst_host_count, dst_host_same_srv_rate, dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate, dst_host_rerror_rate, serror_rate

*Interpretation:*

Features like dst_host_count and dst_host_same_srv_rate have a strong influence.

Red dots (high values) on the right indicate that high feature values push the prediction toward "attack", while blue (low values) on the left show they push toward "normal".

The wide spread of SHAP values (x-axis) for these features indicates they significantly affect the model's decision.

**2. Poly Kernel**
Top Influential Features:

dst_host_same_srv_rate, dst_host_count, rerror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, srv_serror_rate

*Interpretation:*

The poly kernel picks up complex, nonlinear interactions.

dst_host_same_srv_rate again plays a major role, indicating this feature consistently impacts the prediction across models.

High feature values (red) again shift predictions positively (toward attack), while low values (blue) may reduce the risk score.

**3. RBF Kernel **


Top Influential Features:

dst_host_count, dst_host_srv_count, srv_diff_host_rate, flag, protocol_type

*Interpretation:*

RBF focuses on local structure in data and seems to distribute importance across a slightly broader set of features.

While dst_host_count is again top-ranked, features like flag, protocol_type, and src_bytes start playing stronger roles here.

The SHAP values are more concentrated around zero, suggesting the RBF model may make more conservative decisions compared to others.

**4. Sigmoid Kernel:**


Top Influential Features:

dst_host_count, dst_host_same_srv_rate, dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate, serror_rate, protocol_type

*Interpretation:*

The sigmoid kernel's behavior lies somewhere between linear and RBF. It still prioritizes dst_host_count and related host-based traffic metrics.

The SHAP values range more widely here (up to Â±10), meaning the sigmoid model reacts more sharply to certain features.

protocol_type and srv_diff_host_rate also emerge as significant.

**Conclusion**
dst_host_count is the most influential feature across all kernels.

Linear and polynomial kernels rely heavily on host-based and connection rate features.

RBF and sigmoid kernels begin to factor in connection details like protocol_type and flag.

The spread of SHAP values gives insight into model sensitivity: sigmoid and poly models are more sensitive than RBF.
